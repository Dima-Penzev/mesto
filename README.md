# Mesto

**About**

Many of us like to travel. At the same time, we try to capture interesting and beautiful places on our smartphones or other devices. Fortunately, modern technologies allow us to do this. But we also want to share our impressions with other people. Therefore, we created the project "Mesto". 

**Functionality**

This service gives its users the opportunity to upload photos of visited places. The service allows you to create a user profile, namely, specify the name, occupation and upload his photo. Also in this application, the user can add cards with photos and a description to them. In turn, other users can mark their favorite photos by clicking on the "heart" symbol in the lower right corner of the card.

**Technologies used in the project:**

- HTML
- CSS
- Grid layout
- BEM
- Adaptive design
- JavaScript
- OOP
- REST API
- WebPack

In the future, I plan to transfer this project to React.
